# Project-3

The purpose of the project is to recreate the basic functionality of a site like Tumblr, using laravel. The site allows users to register accounts, view a feed of posts made by all users (including themselves), and edit/delete those posts.

In order to contribute to the project, you must follow 4 basic steps:

1. On the command line, run "composer install". 

2. Then, run "npm install".

3. Next, copy the env example file's contents into your local env file. Run "cp .env.example .env"

4. Generate a new, unique app key that will allow you to contribute to the project. Run "php artisan key:generate" and make sure that it is present in your env file.

After that, you should be able to work on the project!
